          As a Financial Analyst, I have completed financial modeling for over
          50 companies across three major sectors in my country, including
          refineries. Over the past four years, I dedicated myself to this role,
          often working extra unpaid hours, progressing from an untrained
          beginner to leading the financial team at one of my country&apos;s
          most established and reputable brokerage and fund institution.

          Originally a Biomedical Engineering major, my curiosity led me to add
          an Economics minor and make a career pivot into finance. This path has
          inspired me to pursue advanced studies in the UK, where I look forward
          to entering the global finance job market with a strong work ethic,
          curiosity, and analytical rigourâ€”especially in technical sectors that
          demand precision and insight.
